It is also affecting the growing demand for drone services, but in some cases, several service business entities that offer drone services are still often facing difficulties in their jobs distribution, products marketing and promotion, customers' data collection and management. As the information and communication technology growing very rapidly, it requires business entities to take advantage of these technologies by looking forward effective and efficient business and marketing strategy for their products, so it will not have the company to spend a lot of operational, even marketing costs, and reduce the other miscellaneous costs. One of the effective and efficient methods that can help is by implementing the Business to Customer (B2C) system on a company website. B2C is a business model that mediates between business actors and their customers. This B2C can help drone and other multimedia services entities in their customers' data collection, jobs distribution to vendors, customers' data management and the most critical goal is mediating the customers who are seeking for drone or multimedia services with the experienced and expert operators. With the system, it can also help strengthen the relationship between the company or business entity with their customers. In the end, it can bring many benefits to the company for their products marketing, meet the customer up-to-date needs information and improve their services product for a better quality.},

Today's music is not only a composition that is presented specifically for the sake of music itself, but music can collaborate with other visual arts such as movies. In the movie itself, there are various forms of editing techniques, for example, montage. In the montage, a shot is not only connected with other shots but must be reunited or made into conflict (the attraction of montage) to produce strong or deep meaning. The role of music/audio as a constructor of the atmosphere in a movie is called scoring. Scoring can also mean communication with the audience that supports the visual aspects presented in the movie so that the message from the movie can be delivered well, especially movies that use special editing techniques such as montage, which will be increasingly difficult to understand when not using right music elements. This research is expected to be a reference in understanding the technique of scoring music for ordinary people.},

Several problems in the learning process, which are currently completely virtual, raise new problems, especially related to practicums which require teaching modules as guidelines for practicum implementation but still maintain the impression of interactive learning. For this reason, Augmented Reality technology is applied as a solution to build a practical human anatomy module, then called AIVE Platform embedded in smartphones to provide informative and immersive learning that can be run indoors or outdoors so that it is not limited by space and time. This platform can run on Android and iOS which is built on the AR Foundation framework to work across platforms. This module has followed the rules of the anatomical atlas that include labels on each part, there is also a login system to store student usage history, as well as the choice of learning mode. This module has been licensed to operate from a teaching doctor in anatomy to be used as a teaching module. The PIECES framework used to analyze the importance and satisfaction level of the platform gives score 4.085 out of 5 on and 4.081 out of 5 respectively.},

   abstract = {With the rapid development of IoT technology in various fields such as smart cities and industry 4.0, the need for wireless sensor network-based systems has increased, one of which is the concept of using a vehicle as a mobile sensor network or known as VaaMSN. Many developers use the IoT platform as a cloud computing service in developing the VaaMSN system. However, not all IoT platform service providers provide monitoring features on every device and provide information such as device location, purpose, condition. Therefore, this research aims to develop an IoT Platform that can receive data and provide information on each device, making it easier to process data and control devices. Therefore, this research aims to develop an IoT platform called the SEMAR-IoT-Platform that able to received data and provide information on each device for easier data processing and control devices. The SEMAR-IoT-Platform integrates Big Data, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, using the principles of Extract, Transfer, and Load (ETL) for data processing and provides communication services using HTTP-POST, MQTT, and NATS. The test results show that the system has been successfully implemented to complement a simple IoT system with an average delay time of HTTP, NATS, and MQTT communications of less than 150ms for the data storage process, and for the data visualization process has an average delay time of less than 300ms.},

   abstract = {The performance condition of an athlete must always be maintained, one way to maintain that performance is by training. Each individual has different abilities and physiological responses in receiving the portion of the exercise. Physical exercise that exceeds the body's ability can worsen the condition of the athlete itself which can result in excessive fatigue (overtraining) or can even result in injury. Therefore a system is needed to monitor the condition of the physiological response when given the intensity of the training load so that the portion of the training provided provides positive benefits for the athlete. This system was developed using an oxymetry sensor, microcontroller and wifi module ESP8266. This system is used to collect heart rate and oxygen saturation data, then with the existing formula the heart rate value is converted to a CVL (Cardiovascular Load) value to determine the level of fatigue in athletes when given the intensity of the training load. By using a web-based application, measurement data is displayed in realtime to make it easier to see the results of monitoring. From the experimental results the system can monitor changes in the physiological condition of the athlete when given the intensity of the training load. Finally, the developed system can collect athlete's physiological data, and can store the data in a database and display it in a web application.},

In addition, the largest percentage of energy emissions come from the transportation sector, specifically on road transportation. Therefore, the need for a quality detection system that is capable of distributing and displaying large data information in real-time cannot be resolved by the system currently used by the government. This research offers a solution to the implementation of data abstraction in cloud computing which is built using the concept microservice architecture and integrated with mobile-based sensors to detect air quality in real-time. This solution consists of integrated cloud computing services using Smart Environment Monitoring and Analytical in Real-time (SEMAR) and Vehicles as Mobile Sensor Networks (VaaMSN) to detecting air quality. SEMAR was built with microservice references consist of data abstraction, communication, data analytical with business analytics proccess, data storage with Big data service and also real-time visualization in maps, chart, and table through dasboard website. Through the experiments that we did show that the microservice of data abstraction layer can be installed at the SEMAR stage indicating that the average delay in sending information is around 0.09 ms (90μs), this indicates that the system can be said to be real-time. With specific and real-time locations in data visualization, the government can use this method as an new alternative method of air quality.},

This way is used because the passengers are difficult to find the trolley especially during busy time. One of study case from indoor mobile object is the movement of trolley inside the airport. This research used K-NN Fingerprint method on the receiving server to track the trolley position in Airport. The Fingerprint method is used to collect offline data from the received strong bluetooth signal. The K-NN method is used to classify fingerprint result of strong signal data because it is considered simple and has high speed in classification process. Information about the trolley position can be used to return the trolley to the trolley pickup. So, the passengers can easily get the trolley. From the tests carried out using the K-NN Fingerprint method on system, it was found that on the single object, MSE with the smallest result was when using k = 1 which is 0.6866 meters. In multi objects, MSE with the smallest result is when using k = 1 which is 3.3951 meters and tended to increase to the highest when using k = 10 which is 13.1432 meters. Meanwhile, the largest number of grids that is 54, 825 grids produces the smallest MSE and the number of grids that is at least 3, 531 grids produces the highest MSE.

To send data or information or communication lines are needed to request signals from the sender to the recipient. The use of light as a transmission medium is something that has not been used in sending and receiving data. At present the transmission or reception of data generally still uses wire and wireless. LiFi (Light Fidelity) is a technology that uses LED (Light Emitting Dioda) to transmit data to recipients with changes in light intensity so fast that it cannot be seen by the human eye. Data is encoded into light by varying the level of blinking of LEDs (on or off) for intensity to produce data streams that are different from bits 1 and 0. This paper focuses on simple Li-Fi desain, measurement and comparison with GeoLiFi from Oledcomm.},

   abstract = {© 2019 IEEE. The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used in various aspects such as industry, manufacturing, health, agriculture and others. One of the uses of IoT is as an environmental monitoring system. In its application, IoT-based environmental monitoring systems are composed of one or more sensors placed in various locations and connected to each other using certain protocols. The problem arises when thousands of IoT devices connected together in one network and using the server-client connection model which raises several works in the synchronization process and access control management. This kind of network depends on a server as the center of control management that work as storing and distributing data from the sensor so that any data comes from the server is considered correct. To overcome this problem, it is proposed an IoT system that uses Blockchain technology which is a distributed data structure that forms blocks that do not require central authority and verification from third parties. From the experiments conducted can be evaluated that blockchain communication is much slower compared to MQTT communication protocol in terms of speed. The data transmission between node is measured with an average delay of 200ms. This system also visualizes data in graph with a high mobility data collection using vehicle so that it can be used to be an alternative of public participatorial measurement.},

   abstract = {© 2019 IEEE. The digestive system is a vital organ, considering its function in processing food and drinks that are consumed every day so it is very important to be maintained. But sometimes people have a lack of awareness and knowledge of the initial symptoms of digestive diseases so that being a factor causing the disease to be serious can even cause death. Identification of symptoms as early as possible is very important for the diagnosis process so that immediate control measures can be taken to prevent and overcome the spread of disease. Anamnesis process is needed to get the symptoms of the disease, question and answer process between the patient and medical personnel whose results are stored in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) in the form of narration to assist in the process of Clinical Decision Support (CDS). EMR is often difficult to do computing processing due to inappropriate grammar. For computers to process natural languages, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used. In this study, an NLP system was created that can identify symptoms of the digestive disease by using to optimize the CDS process. The method used to identify symptoms of the disease is Named Entity Recognition (NER), which determines which tokens are included in the symptoms of the disease. The model trained with 800 epochs produces f1-score accuracy of 0.79. Experimental results show that the NER process supported by stemming and removing stopwords in pre-processes can improve system accuracy.},

The development of television from time to time experienced improvements in terms of the technology used. From initially using analog systems to the present in Indonesia will switch to using digital systems. This transition is nothing but due to offset the current technology. In addition, the digitalization of television in Indonesia is useful in terms of frequency efficiency itself and the quality of broadcast videos. Besides that there are other technologies that have better video quality than Analog TV, namely Internet Television Protocol (IPTV). IPTV utilizes the internet protocol as a medium for channeling its content. IPTV and DVB-T2 Digital TV have better picture quality than Analog TV. But IPTV technology was first used and had a different protocol compared to Digital DVB-T2 TV. Therefore, in this research, measurements of image quality received by the public were carried out on Digital TV DVB-T2 and IPTV broadcasts. With this measurement, it is expected to be able to know the comparison of the image quality on DVB-T2 and IPTV Digital TV that is present in the civilian at this time. The research method used is a comparative / comparison method using quantitative types of research. In this research, video quality was measured by PSNR, SSIM, and VQM parameters.

To address this demand, both distributed system and parallel processing are becoming a requirement in an embedded system. Therefore, research about algorithm and application of parallel processing is very important to be conducted. Implementing MPI's standard to an embedded system will increase the application portability, therefore parallel programming will be easier to be implemented. This paper presents a novel design and implementation of MPI on top of our microkernel named FLoW which are built and run on an embedded system. To decrease communication latency, we propose a communication layer design based on MPI. On this layer, a process manager is made to handle multi-processes and routing services mechanism. In addition, a mailbox system is created to temporarily keep the message which is sent when the collective operation occurs. From our experiments, the time required to complete the data transmission process ranges from 400 to 500 microseconds for each process, and in parallel task testing using MPI, the speedup can achieve up to 40-50.},

To overcome the issue, then recognition using Indonesian language model and accousticc model and dictionary. Automatic Speech Recognizier is build using engine CMU Sphinx with modified english language to Indonesian Language database and XBMC used as the multimedia player. The experiment is using 10 volunteers testing items based on 7 commands. The volunteers is classifiedd by the genders, 5 Male &amp; 5 female. 10 samples is taken in each command, continue with each volunteer perform 10 testing command. Each volunteer also have to try all 7 command that already provided. Based on percentage clarification table, the word “Kanan” had the most recognize with percentage 83 while “pilih” is the lowest one. The word which had the most wrong clarification is “kembali” with percentagee 67, while the word “kanan” is the lowest one. From the result of Recognition Rate by male there are several command such as “Kembali”, “Utama”, “Atas “ and “Bawah” has the low Recognition Rate. Especially for “kembali” cannot be recognized as the command in the female voices but in male voice that command has 4 of RR this is because the command doesn’t have similar word in english near to “kembali” so the system unrecognize the command. Also for the command “Pilih” using the female voice has 80 of RR but for the male voice has only 4 of RR. This problem is mostly because of the different voice characteristic between adult male and female which male has lower voice frequencies (from 85 to 180 Hz) than woman (165 to 255 Hz).The result of the experiment showed that each man had different number of recognition rate caused by the difference tone, pronunciation, and speed of speech.

Humanoid robot can perform complex motions, including the balancing, walking, and kicking skills required in the RoboCup robot soccer competition. The humanoid robot from the Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya (EEPIS) research center named FLoW. This paper discusses about the FLoW head mechanism. Flow head mechanism is split into three parts there are eye mechanism, head mechanism and neck mechanism. The forward kinematic from FLoW head mechanism is obtained to generate workspace of motion. The FloW head workspace of motion is compared to human workspace of motion. From the experiment the motion of FLoW head already approached human easy head motion.},

Human can recognize an object just by looking at the environment, this capability is very useful for designing the reference of humanoid robot with the ability of adapting it on its environment. By knowing the field conditions that exist in such environments, robot can understand the obstacles or anything that can be passed. To do that, robot vision needs to have a knowledge to understanding an obstacles that exist around it. We investigate possible improvements that can be achieved in depth estimation by merging coded apertures and stereo cameras. The demonstrated results of this analysis are encouraging in the sense that coded apertures can provide valuable complementary information to stereo vision based depth estimation in some cases. We show that with this system, it is possible to extract depth information robustly, by utilizing the inherent relation between the disparity and defocus cues, even for scene regions which are problematic for stereo matching.},

   abstract = {As a flexible and cost effective solution for a scalable Internet-access network, we have studied the Wireless Internet-access Mesh NETwork (WIMNET) that is composed of multiple access points (APs). WIMNET utilizes multi-hop communications between APs to provide access to the Internet through a gateway (GW) from associated hosts, which becomes increasingly vulnerable to problems of the available bandwidth degradation and the network latency. As a result, real-time applications such as Voice-over-IP (VoIP) and video conferences are hard in WIMNET. In this paper, we propose a traffic control method with consumed bandwidth estimation to afford real-time applications in WIMNET. After the consumed bandwidth by the requesting applications is estimated, the least priority application is repeatedly dropped at GW using the leaky bucket traffic shaping, until it does not exceed the available bandwidth in WIMNET. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified through simulations using the QualNet simulator. © 2011 IEEE.},

We develop a testing framework using Markov chain in order to test the allocation algorithm performance to fit the allocation behavior in RTOS. The framework generates various type of scenario test which can determine deterministic and nondeterministic of the algorithm based on the performance result.

   abstract = {Wireless mesh networks is a network which has high mobility and flexibility network. In Wireless mesh networks nodes are free to move and able to automatically build a network connection with other nodes. High mobility, heterogeneous condition and intermittent network connectivity cause data packets drop during wireless communication and it becomes a problem in the wireless mesh networks. This condition can happen because wireless mesh networks use connectionless networking type such as IP protocol which it is not tolerant to delay. To solve this condition it is needed a technology to keep data packets when the network is disconnect. Delay tolerant technology is a technology that provides store and forward mechanism and it can prevent packet data dropping during communication. In our research, we proposed a test bed wireless mesh networks implementation by using proactive routing protocol and combining with delay tolerant technology. We used Batman-adv routing protocol and IBR-DTN on our research. We measured some particular performance aspect of networking such as packet loss, delay, and throughput of the network. We identified that delay tolerant could keep packet data from dropping better than current wireless mesh networks in the intermittent network condition. We also proved that IBR-DTN and Batman-adv could run together on the wireless mesh networks. In The experiment throughput test result of IBR-DTN was higher than Current TCP on the LoS (Line of Side) and on environment with obstacle.},

Bringing human behavior into a computer system is done by mimicking how humans look. Looking at using two cameras in combination with the sensor structure. To process the device requires a large computing. Be a challenge for Portable CPU that have lower capabilities than high end CPU. For that humanoid robot can perform tasks simultaneously and can accelerate, especially in image processing using portable CPU required a method that makes the processing into realtime. Achieving realtime with data from previous researcher can not be done with sequential algorithms when the complexity is high. After analyzing the problem was built parallel camera mapping process using multithread algorithm. This paper aims to accelerate the basic process of making the map so as to achieve realtime. This research aims to change the previous process that runs sequentially into a parallel system using multithread algorithm. The results of each process are compared between parallel systems with multithread algorithm and do not use parallel systems. There is a change in speed between the two processes. Further research is concerned with improving the mapping environment results when visualized.},

SEIC (DCT or DWT) consists of transform coding and low-weight code. Transform coding is used to reduce the data size and low-weight code is used to reduce the number of pulse transmission in pulse-based modulation. We investigates the system performance in terms of visual quality, energy efficiency and robustness against transmission error. Moreover, we compare our method with well-known image compression standard, such as PNG, JPEG and JPEG 2000. The results show that our proposed method outperform them in most-metrics.

WIMNET is composed of wirelessly connected access points (APs), where any host can basically access to the Internet through multihop communications between APs with IEEE 802.11 standard. In WIMNET, undesirable situations can often happen such that some links dominate the bandwidth while others become insufficient due to the limited shared bandwidth. However, the contention resolution mechanism using a random backoff-time in the CSMA/CA protocol of 802.11 standards is not sufficient for handling real-time traffic in multihop wireless communications. Previously, we have proposed the concept of the CSMA-based Fixed Backoff time Switching (CSMA-FBS) method for WIMNET to improve the performance by giving necessary link activation chances for multi-hop communications. We implemented our proposal on the QualNet simulator, and verify its effectiveness through simulations. In this paper, we present an implementation of the FBS method in Linux kernel to show its practicality and investigate the performance in a real network. Our design consists of implementations or modifications of the five programs: Kernel configuration, Debugfs, Minstrel, iw, and FBSdaemon.},

However, industrial, agricultural and domestic water is discarded into rivers directly in many developing countries, since drainage systems have not been completely constructed. Water quality monitoring using radio-controlled submarine provide an opportunity to develop baseline monitoring system for river water ecosystem health indicator. We propose a design modification of radio-controlled submarine for river water quality monitoring. Our design consists of modification for navigation system by added external motor, IMU and GPS; modification of processing and control system by added micro controllers and mini pc, and modification of water sensors system.},

   abstract = {As a flexible and cost-efficient scalable Internet access network, we studied architectures, protocols, and design optimizations of the Wireless Internet-access Mesh NETwork (WIMNET). WIMNET is composed of multiple access points (APs) connected through multihop wireless communications on IEEE 802.11 standards. The increasing popularity of real-time applications such as IP-phones and IP-TV means that they should be supported in WIMNET. However, the contention resolution mechanism using a random backoff-time in the CSMA/CA protocol of 802.11 standards is not sufficient for handling real-time traffic in multihop wireless communications. In this paper, we propose a Fixed Backoff-time Switching (FBS) method for the CSMA/CA protocol to improve the real-time traffic performance in WIMNET by giving the necessary activation chances to each link. We implement our proposal on the QualNet simulator, and verify its effectiveness through simulations on three network topologies with four scenarios.},

   abstract = {As a flexible and cost-efficient scalable Internet access network, we have studied architectures, protocols, and de- sign optimizations of the Wireless Internet-access Mesh NETwork (WIMNET). WIMNET is composed of wirelessly connected access points (APs), where any host can basically access to the Internet through multihop communications between APs. In WIMNET, undesirable situations can often happen such that some links dominate the bandwidth while others become insuffi- cient due to the limited shared bandwidth. To improve the performance by avoiding them, controls of activation chances for wireless links depending on their traffics are effective. Thus, previously, we have proposed the Fixed Backoff-time Switching (FBS) method for the CSMA/CA protocol, and verified the effectiveness using the QualNet simulator. In this paper, we present an implementation design of the FBS method in Linux kernel to show its practicality and investigate the performance in a real network. Our design consists of implementations or modifications of the five programs: Kernel configuration, Debugfs, Minstrel, iw, and FBSdaemon.},

   abstract = {HPC (High Performance Computing) has become more popular in the last few years. With the benefits on high computational power, HPC has impact on industry, scientific research and educational activities. Implementing HPC as a curriculum in universities could be consuming a lot of resources because well-known HPC system are using Personal Computer or Server. By using PC as the practical moduls it is need great resources and spaces. This paper presents an innovative high performance computing cluster system to support education learning activities in HPC course with small size, low cost, and yet powerful enough. In recent years, High Performance computing usually implanted in cluster computing and require high specification computer and expensive cost. It is not efficient applying High Performance Computing in Educational research activiry such as learning in Class. Therefore, our proposed system is created with inexpensive component by using Embedded System to make High Performance Computing applicable for leaning in the class. Students involved in the construction of embedded system, built clusters from basic embedded and network components, do benchmark performance, and implement simple parallel case using the cluster. In this research we performed evaluation of embedded systems comparing with i5 PC, the results of our embedded system performance of NAS benchmark are similar with i5 PCs. We also conducted surveys about student learning satisfaction that with embedded system students are able to learn about HPC from building the system until making an application that use HPC system.},

   abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) works continuously to gather information from sensors that generate large volumes of data to be handled and processed by applications. Current efforts in sensor networks focus more on networking and development services for a variety of applications and less on processing and integrating data from heterogeneous sensors. There is an increased need for information to become shareable across different sensors, database platforms, and applications that are not easily implemented in traditional database systems. To solve the issue of these large amounts of data from different servers and database platforms (including sensor data), a semantic sensor web service platform is needed to enable a machine to extract meaningful information from the sensor’s raw data. This additionally helps to minimize and simplify data processing and to deduce new information from existing data. This paper implements a semantic web data platform (SWDP) to manage the distribution of data sensors based on the semantic database system. SWDP uses sensors for temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, luminosity, and noise. The system uses the Sesame semantic web database for data processing and a WSN to distribute, minimize, and simplify information processing. The sensor nodes are distributed in different places to collect sensor data. The SWDP generates context information in the form of a resource description framework. The experiment results demonstrate that the SWDP is more efficient than the traditional database system in terms of memory usage and processing time.},

   abstract = {Disaster multi-robot has a significant role in a disaster area to do many tasks like detection of fire, search and rescue of victims, etc. It needs to build good communication between the operator and multi-robot and among multi-robot themselves to perform their tasks quickly and efficiently. This relates with the queue message protocol system. In this research, we implemented the queue message protocol on mesh topology and integrated it on the robot platform. Recently, development of IoT (Internet of Things) Technology causes development of communication protocol. MQTT and CoAP are among the communication protocols used for IoT needs. Both protocols performance were compared when used and implemented into disaster multi-robot. We also integrated MQTT protocol and robot platform python based (UNR-PF). The result shows that MQTT protocol is easier to be implemented on to disaster multi-robot platform (UNR-PF) on mesh topology than CoAP, and that data transfer rate of MQTT protocol has data transfer rate higher than CoAP.},
