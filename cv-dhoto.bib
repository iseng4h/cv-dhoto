   abstract = {With the rapid development of IoT technology in various fields such as smart cities and industry 4.0, the need for wireless sensor network-based systems has increased, one of which is the concept of using a vehicle as a mobile sensor network or known as VaaMSN. Many developers use the IoT platform as a cloud computing service in developing the VaaMSN system. However, not all IoT platform service providers provide monitoring features on every device and provide information such as device location, purpose, condition. Therefore, this research aims to develop an IoT Platform that can receive data and provide information on each device, making it easier to process data and control devices. Therefore, this research aims to develop an IoT platform called the SEMAR-IoT-Platform that able to received data and provide information on each device for easier data processing and control devices. The SEMAR-IoT-Platform integrates Big Data, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, using the principles of Extract, Transfer, and Load (ETL) for data processing and provides communication services using HTTP-POST, MQTT, and NATS. The test results show that the system has been successfully implemented to complement a simple IoT system with an average delay time of HTTP, NATS, and MQTT communications of less than 150ms for the data storage process, and for the data visualization process has an average delay time of less than 300ms.},

   abstract = {The performance condition of an athlete must always be maintained, one way to maintain that performance is by training. Each individual has different abilities and physiological responses in receiving the portion of the exercise. Physical exercise that exceeds the body's ability can worsen the condition of the athlete itself which can result in excessive fatigue (overtraining) or can even result in injury. Therefore a system is needed to monitor the condition of the physiological response when given the intensity of the training load so that the portion of the training provided provides positive benefits for the athlete. This system was developed using an oxymetry sensor, microcontroller and wifi module ESP8266. This system is used to collect heart rate and oxygen saturation data, then with the existing formula the heart rate value is converted to a CVL (Cardiovascular Load) value to determine the level of fatigue in athletes when given the intensity of the training load. By using a web-based application, measurement data is displayed in realtime to make it easier to see the results of monitoring. From the experimental results the system can monitor changes in the physiological condition of the athlete when given the intensity of the training load. Finally, the developed system can collect athlete's physiological data, and can store the data in a database and display it in a web application.},

   abstract = {In the current era of communication has various challenges that include the intensity of information exchange more often, the amount of information carried and the speed in exchanging information. Communication is not only in the form of text and sound but also in the form of pictures and videos. This study tries to use digital data in the form of video with the aim of providing a view of the PSNR measurement simulation. The method used is modulation of QAM 64, 256, 1024 and 4096 through terahertz channels (0.1-10 THz). Simulation results show that in QAM 64 the PSNR value is 35.2 dB to 36.6 dB. The PSNR value decreases as the M-ary increases. PSNR at 256 QAM ranges from 25.9 to 26.5 dB. PSNR in QAM 1024 is stable at magnitude 16.3 to 16.5. Whereas PSNR in QAM 4096 ranged from 15.0 to 15.25. From this study shows the greater the value of PSNR, the quality of information sent is increasingly similar. In addition, the higher the M-ary, the data carried will also be large so as to speed up the transmission time.

Determination and placement of audio aspects into visual form are things done in the music scoring process. Of course, it will be very inconvenient and inefficient when making music must be through recording instruments manually through the studio. As technology develops in the world of music production, making music for films can now be made using only a computer. This can happen thanks to the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software. Nowadays, various types of DAW are emerging, including one that is quite well known, Fruity Loops Studio or commonly called FL Studio.

	Abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) works continuously to gather information from sensors that generate large volumes of data to be handled and processed by applications. Current efforts in sensor networks focus more on networking and development services for a variety of applications and less on processing and integrating data from heterogeneous sensors. There is an increased need for information to become shareable across different sensors, database platforms, and applications that are not easily implemented in traditional database systems. To solve the issue of these large amounts of data from different servers and database platforms (including sensor data), a semantic sensor web service platform is needed to enable a machine to extract meaningful information from the sensor's raw data. This additionally helps to minimize and simplify data processing and to deduce new information from existing data. This paper implements a semantic web data platform (SWDP) to manage the distribution of data sensors based on the semantic database system. SWDP uses sensors for temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, luminosity, and noise. The system uses the Sesame semantic web database for data processing and a WSN to distribute, minimize, and simplify information processing. The sensor nodes are distributed in different places to collect sensor data. The SWDP generates context information in the form of a resource description framework. The experiment results demonstrate that the SWDP is more efficient than the traditional database system in terms of memory usage and processing time.},

To integrate the water monitoring system into the big data technology for real-time analysis, we have engaged in the ongoing project named smart environment monitoring and analytic in real-time system (SEMAR), which provides the IoT-big data platform for water monitoring. However, SEMAR does not have an analytical system yet. This paper proposes the analytical system for water quality classification using Pollution Index method, which is an extension of SEMAR. Besides, the communication protocol is updated from REST to MQTT. Furthermore, the real-time user interface is implemented for visualisation. The evaluations confirmed that the data analytic function adopting the linear SVM and decision tree algorithms achieves more than 90{\%} for the estimation accuracy with 0.019075 for the MSE.},

In the athletics sport, in addition to agility and good ability, an athlete must have a strong mentality. Mental of the athlete is very critical on its performance. Most successful athletes achieve their peak achievement of 60{\%} to 90{\%} influenced by mental factors and the ability of athletes to master their psychological state, One of the elements of psychology that greatly affect is the concentration. Not a few athletes who have low concentration power, so it takes practice to improve the power of concentration. Therefore, the research is useful to help runners or athletes in training the power of concentration by utilizing virtual reality technology. We develop a training system for athletes by utilizing Virtual Reality (VR) that calculates head movement as concentration measurement. This system consists of VR hardware and VR environment. We have result from an experiment that said we could measure the concentration of an athlete by measuring how much the attention of an athlete is distracted. Therefore we develop a system that can simulate that. Virtual reality technology is chosen because it can deliver an immersive experience. By simulating the environment of the field during a sprinting game, it is expected that the runners will get used to the atmosphere and can concentrate on giving their best performance.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Human can recognize an object just by looking at the environment, this capability is very useful for designing the reference of humanoid robot with the ability of adapting it on its environment. By knowing the field conditions that exist in such environments, robot can understand the obstacles or anything that can be passed. To do that, robot vision needs to have a knowledge to understanding an obstacles that exist around it. We investigate possible improvements that can be achieved in depth estimation by merging coded apertures and stereo cameras. The demonstrated results of this analysis are encouraging in the sense that coded apertures can provide valuable complementary information to stereo vision based depth estimation in some cases. We show that with this system, it is possible to extract depth information robustly, by utilizing the inherent relation between the disparity and defocus cues, even for scene regions which are problematic for stereo matching.},

	Abstract = {--- Human eyes can recognize an object just by looking at the environment; this capability is very useful for designing the reference of a humanoid robot with the ability for adapting to its environment. By knowing the field conditions that exist in such environments, the robot can understand the obstacles or anything that can be passed. To do that, robot's vision needs to has the knowledge to understand an obstacle that exists around it. Because of these problems, this paper shows a method for reducing the error rate of vacant space in the data depth by combining a stereo camera and structure sensor. Merging the stereo camera and structure sensor can extract depth information becomes dense. The proposed method has been successfully running the whole algorithm that already built and has a density of depth with an average error rate of vacant space is 18.10{\%}.},

The process is observed more deeply that when the human mind does not do the behavior in turn like looking at the whole room then just remember, but humans can see at once remember simultaneously. Bringing human behavior into a computer system is done by mimicking how humans look. Looking at using two cameras in combination with the sensor structure. To process the device requires a large computing. Be a challenge for Portable CPU that have lower capabilities than high end CPU. For that humanoid robot can perform tasks simultaneously and can accelerate, especially in image processing using portable CPU required a method that makes the processing into realtime. Achieving realtime with data from previous researcher can not be done with sequential algorithms when the complexity is high. After analyzing the problem was built parallel camera mapping process using multithread algorithm. This paper aims to accelerate the basic process of making the map so as to achieve realtime. This research aims to change the previous process that runs sequentially into a parallel system using multithread algorithm. The results of each process are compared between parallel systems with multithread algorithm and do not use parallel systems. There is a change in speed between the two processes. Further research is concerned with improving the mapping environment results when visualized.},

In this paper, we propose a simple and energy efficient image compression (SEIC), based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) transform, in addition to our previous proposed method based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (SEIC-DWT). SEIC (DCT or DWT) consists of transform coding and low-weight code. Transform coding is used to reduce the data size and low-weight code is used to reduce the number of pulse transmission in pulse-based modulation. We investigates the system performance in terms of visual quality, energy efficiency and robustness against transmission error. Moreover, we compare our method with well-known image compression standard, such as PNG, JPEG and JPEG 2000. The results show that our proposed method outperform them in most-metrics.

With the benefits on high computational power, HPC has impact on industry, scientific research and educational activities. Implementing HPC as a curriculum in universities could be consuming a lot of resources because well-known HPC system are using Personal Computer or Server. By using PC as the practical moduls it is need great resources and spaces. This paper presents an innovative high performance computing cluster system to support education learning activities in HPC course with small size, low cost, and yet powerful enough. In recent years, High Performance computing usually implanted in cluster computing and require high specification computer and expensive cost. It is not efficient applying High Performance Computing in Educational research activiry such as learning in Class. Therefore, our proposed system is created with inexpensive component by using Embedded System to make High Performance Computing applicable for leaning in the class. Students involved in the construction of embedded system, built clusters from basic embedded and network components, do benchmark performance, and implement simple parallel case using the cluster. In this research we performed evaluation of embedded systems comparing with i5 PC, the results of our embedded system performance of NAS benchmark are similar with i5 PCs. We also conducted surveys about student learning satisfaction that with embedded system students are able to learn about HPC from building the system until making an application that use HPC system.},

	Abstract = {Wireless mesh networks is a network which has high mobility and flexibility network. In Wireless mesh networks nodes are free to move and able to automatically build a network connection with other nodes. High mobility, heterogeneous condition and intermittent network connectivity cause data packets drop during wireless communication and it becomes a problem in the wireless mesh networks. This condition can happen because wireless mesh networks use connectionless networking type such as IP protocol which it is not tolerant to delay. To solve this condition it is needed a technology to keep data packets when the network is disconnect. Delay tolerant technology is a technology that provides store and forward mechanism and it can prevent packet data dropping during communication. In our research, we proposed a test bed wireless mesh networks implementation by using proactive routing protocol and combining with delay tolerant technology. We used Batman-adv routing protocol and IBR-DTN on our research. We measured some particular performance aspect of networking such as packet loss, delay, and throughput of the network. We identified that delay tolerant could keep packet data from dropping better than current wireless mesh networks in the intermittent network condition. We also proved that IBR-DTN and Batman-adv could run together on the wireless mesh networks. In The experiment throughput test result of IBR-DTN was higher than Current TCP on the LoS (Line of Side) and on environment with obstacle.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The purpose of multimedia devices development is controlling through voice. Nowdays voice that can be recognized only in English. To overcome the issue, then recognition using Indonesian language model and accousticc model and dictionary. Automatic Speech Recognizier is build using engine CMU Sphinx with modified english language to Indonesian Language database and XBMC used as the multimedia player. The experiment is using 10 volunteers testing items based on 7 commands. The volunteers is classifiedd by the genders, 5 Male {\&} 5 female. 10 samples is taken in each command, continue with each volunteer perform 10 testing command. Each volunteer also have to try all 7 command that already provided. Based on percentage clarification table, the word ``Kanan'' had the most recognize with percentage 83{\%} while ``pilih'' is the lowest one. The word which had the most wrong clarification is ``kembali'' with percentagee 67{\%}, while the word ``kanan'' is the lowest one. From the result of Recognition Rate by male there are several command such as ``Kembali'', ``Utama'', ``Atas `` and ``Bawah'' has the low Recognition Rate. Especially for ``kembali'' cannot be recognized as the command in the female voices but in male voice that command has 4{\%} of RR this is because the command doesn't have similar word in english near to ``kembali'' so the system unrecognize the command. Also for the command ``Pilih'' using the female voice has 80{\%} of RR but for the male voice has only 4{\%} of RR. This problem is mostly because of the different voice characteristic between adult male and female which male has lower voice frequencies (from 85 to 180 Hz) than woman (165 to 255 Hz).The result of the experiment showed that each man had different number of recognition rate caused by the difference tone, pronunciation, and speed of speech. For further work needs to be done in order to improving the accouracy of the Indonesian Automatic Speech Recognition system.Keywords: Automatic Speech Recognizer, Indonesian Acoustic Model, CMU Sphinx, indonesian Language Model, Recognition Rate, XBMC.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {As a flexible and cost effective solution for a scalable Internet-access network, we have studied the Wireless Internet-access Mesh NETwork (WIMNET) that is composed of multiple access points (APs). WIMNET utilizes multi-hop communications between APs to provide access to the Internet through a gateway (GW) from associated hosts, which becomes increasingly vulnerable to problems of the available bandwidth degradation and the network latency. As a result, real-time applications such as Voice-over-IP (VoIP) and video conferences are hard in WIMNET. In this paper, we propose a traffic control method with consumed bandwidth estimation to afford real-time applications in WIMNET. After the consumed bandwidth by the requesting applications is estimated, the least priority application is repeatedly dropped at GW using the leaky bucket traffic shaping, until it does not exceed the available bandwidth in WIMNET. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified through simulations using the QualNet simulator. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Penyeleksian yang didasarkan pada warna kulit (skin detection) telah terbukti dan merupakan suatu syarat utama dalam melakukan penyeleksian suatu gambar dengan objek manusia. Untuk memilah bagian-bagian tertentu yang kita inginkan dari sebuah gambar digunakan teknik deteksi obyek (Object Detection). Dalam sistem ini kita menggabungkan skin detection dan object detection serta proses terakhir adalah melakukan klasifikasi untuk memutuskan apakah gambar tersebut tergolong pornografi atau tidak. Dalam penelitian ini telah berhasil di implementasi sebuah aplikasi pendeteksi gambar porno kedalam program web browser.

	Abstract = {Disaster multi-robot has a significant role in a disaster area to do many tasks like detection of fire, search and rescue of victims, etc. It needs to build good communication between the operator and multi-robot and among multi-robot themselves to perform their tasks quickly and efficiently. This relates with the queue message protocol system. In this research, we implemented the queue message protocol on mesh topology and integrated it on the robot platform. Recently, development of IoT (Internet of Things) Technology causes development of communication protocol. MQTT and CoAP are among the communication protocols used for IoT needs. Both protocols performance were compared when used and implemented into disaster multi-robot. We also integrated MQTT protocol and robot platform python based (UNR-PF). The result shows that MQTT protocol is easier to be implemented on to disaster multi-robot platform (UNR-PF) on mesh topology than CoAP, and that data transfer rate of MQTT protocol has data transfer rate higher than CoAP.},

The purpose of an integration Mobile Sensor Network and Internet of Things system is to build air quality monitoring system that able to monitor in wide coverage. This system consists of Vehicle as a Mobile Sensors Network (VaaMSN) as edge computing and Smart Environment Monitoring and Analytic in Real-time (SEMAR) cloud computing. VaaMSN is a package of air quality sensor, GPS, 4G Wi-Fi modem and single board computing. SEMAR cloud computing has a time-series database for real-time visualization, Big Data environment and analytics use the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) algorithm. The output from the system are maps, table, and graph visualization. The evaluation obtained from the experimental results shows that the accuracy of both algorithms reaches more than 90{\%}. However, Mean Square Error (MSE) value of SVM algorithm about 0.03076293, but DT algorithm has 10x smaller MSE value than SVM algorithm.},
