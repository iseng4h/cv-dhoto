abstract = {In Indonesia, river water plays important roles in human life; for example, for transportation and economic activities of the inhabitants. However, industrial, agricultural and domestic water is discarded into rivers directly in many developing countries, since drainage systems have not been completely constructed. Water quality monitoring using radio-controlled submarine provide an opportunity to develop baseline monitoring system for river water ecosystem health indicator. We propose a design modification of radio-controlled submarine for river water quality monitoring. Our design consists of modification for navigation system by added external motor, IMU and GPS; modification of processing and control system by added micro controllers and mini pc, and modification of water sensors system.},

abstract = {As a flexible and cost-efficient scalable Internet access network, we studied architectures, protocols, and design optimizations of the Wireless Internet-access Mesh NETwork (WIMNET). WIMNET is composed of multiple access points (APs) connected through multihop wireless communications on IEEE 802.11 standards. The increasing popularity of real-time applications such as IP-phones and IP-TV means that they should be supported in WIMNET. However, the contention resolution mechanism using a random backoff-time in the CSMA/CA protocol of 802.11 standards is not sufficient for handling real-time traffic in multihop wireless communications. In this paper, we propose a Fixed Backoff-time Switching (FBS) method for the CSMA/CA protocol to improve the real-time traffic performance in WIMNET by giving the necessary activation chances to each link. We implement our proposal on the QualNet simulator, and verify its effectiveness through simulations on three network topologies with four scenarios.},
