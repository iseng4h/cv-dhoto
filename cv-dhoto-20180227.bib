abstract = {Coral monitoring has become major focus to prevent coral bleaching so that various methods have been developed by researchers to analyze coral reefs' health. This paper proposed a low cost coral monitoring system based for shallow water based on IoUT architecture. The proposed system consists of buoy as base component, controller unit based on Single Board Computer equipped with 5V power source, underwater camera and communication unit to send data into cloud server. This system is able to extend WiFi signal from underwater camera by using coaxial cable and transmit image into cloud server. From experiment, we measured that reliability delay using coaxial cable to capture and save image is 5,6 seconds. Results on cloud server experiment indicate distributed server's performance is 186,6 seconds comparing to 53,6 seconds on single server. Moreover, we also have developed bleaching classification resulting 84,3{\%} correct results and an online representation model of retrieved coral images.},

By combining parallel tasks analysis upon identical multiprocessor and their processing rate upon heterogeneous system, we have derived an utilization augmentation, which useful for extending capacity augmentation bound. Our experiments shows that there is schedulable task system which is characterized its utilization augmentation upon heterogeneous system under Global EDF with extended capacity augmentation bound.

abstract = {The development of robotics have a great potential to be integrated with educational system. Robotics become more common in elementary and high school students. However, the absence of a module which integrates hardware and software makes harder for them to learn robotic. To help students learning robotics by using an easy to build robot with a dedicated interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) to program it, we propose a module that integrates the simplicity of modular robot with feasible and appealing mobile visual IDE programming apps. A modular robot which allows student to build the robot without have to build it from the scratch, and Mobile visual IDE is an android based apps which allow user to program robot in GUI with a drag and drop icons followed by property editor. The icons represent robot commands such as moving and interacting with objects. This module also support advanced robotics features such as line follower, wall follower and free movement.},

Coral Reef Monitoring used for preventing coral bleaching by using underwater camera to take some pictures that will be sent to data center and then analyze it, Wireless Mess Network Access Point used as the way ROVs 'talking' to each other while doing a monitoring process in a wide river. Then all of the collected data from ROVs and portable sensor will be saved and analyzed to the data center platform based on Hadoop Multi-Node Cluster. The data will be visualized as a chart or a table and can be accessed world-wide We found that, the processing of the data used in the open platform to be relatively straightforward using a combination of SQL. However, the use of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) as data center and more versatile frameworks such as Mapreduce, Hive, Spark, Redis and more flexible set component of features that particularly facilitate working with larger volumes and more heterogeneous data sources.},

By knowing the field conditions that exist in such environments, robot can understand the obstacles or anything that can be passed. To do that, robot vision needs to have a knowledge to understanding an obstacles that exist around it. We investigate possible improvements that can be achieved in depth estimation by merging coded apertures and stereo cameras. The demonstrated results of this analysis are encouraging in the sense that coded apertures can provide valuable complementary information to stereo vision based depth estimation in some cases. We show that with this system, it is possible to extract depth information robustly, by utilizing the inherent relation between the disparity and defocus cues, even for scene regions which are problematic for stereo matching.},

Penyeleksian yang didasarkan pada warna kulit (skin detection) telah terbukti dan merupakan suatu syarat utama dalam melakukan penyeleksian suatu gambar dengan objek manusia. Untuk memilah bagian­bagian tertentu yang kita inginkan dari sebuah gambar digunakan teknik deteksi obyek (Object Detection). Dalam sistem ini kita menggabungkan skin detection dan object detection serta proses terakhir adalah melakukan klasifikasi untuk memutuskan apakah gambar tersebut tergolong pornografi atau tidak. Dalam penelitian ini telah berhasil di implementasi sebuah aplikasi pendeteksi gambar porno kedalam program web browser.

abstract = {Currently, several streaming servers are available to provide a variety of multimedia applications such as VoD (Video-on-Demand), IP-phone, and IP-TV. As a result, the provision of multiple streaming servers on a single machine using the virtualization technology has become important in order to save the operational/management costs while enhancing the performance and the reliability of the system. In this paper, we show the performance evaluation of two representative open source softwares for the virtualization technology, Xen and OpenVZ, in various configurations of applications on three open source streaming servers, Red5, Darwin, and VLC. Our experimental results indicate that OpenVZ provides the better performance for streaming applications with Darwin and VLC whereas Red5 can run only on Xen.},

abstract = {Teknologi Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) merupakan suatu terobosan dalam komunikasi data. Namun demikian faktor keamanan data pada VoIP masih rentan terhadap kemungkinan penyalahgunaan (abuse), hacking, data-sniffing dan berbagai macam ancaman lainnya. Pada paper ini telah dicapai suatu system yang dapat digunakan untuk mengamankan komunikasi V oIP . Dengan menggunakan teknologi Virtual Private Networking (VPN) dapat digunakan untuk mengamankan jalur yang digunakan, serta metode kriptografi pada aplikasi VoIP dapat mengacak suara yang akan dikirimkan sehingga tidak dapat disadap. Dengan eksperimen yang telah dilakukan, penggunaan sistem VPN dan kriptografi pada VoIP terdapat korelasi terhadap bandwidth dan intelligibility suara.},
